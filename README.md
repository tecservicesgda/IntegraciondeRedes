# Network Integration

## Project Description

This project presents the design and configuration of the network infrastructure for the merger of two microenterprises with 30 and 20 employees respectively, connected by a WAN link. The repository includes the Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file (.pkt) and text files with the configuration of the routers and switches.

## Repository Contents

- `integracion.pkt`: Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file containing the logical and physical network design.
- `A-Router_running-config.txt`: Text file with the configuration of Router A (Microenterprise A).
- `B-Router_running-config.txt`: Text file with the configuration of Router B (Microenterprise B).
- `A-Switch-1_running-config.txt`: Text file with the configuration of Switch 1 of Microenterprise A.
- `A-Switch-2_running-config.txt`: Text file with the configuration of Switch 2 of Microenterprise A.
- `A-Switch-3_running-config.txt`: Text file with the configuration of Switch 3 of Microenterprise A.
- `B-Switch-1_running-config.txt`: Text file with the configuration of Switch 1 of Microenterprise B.
- `B-Switch-2_running-config.txt`: Text file with the configuration of Switch 2 of Microenterprise B.
- `B-Switch-3_running-config.txt`: Text file with the configuration of Switch 3 of Microenterprise B.

## Integration Solution

- **WAN Link:** VPN connection over the Internet using ISR4331 routers.
- **Routing Protocol:** RIP for communication between the microenterprises.
- **Network Segmentation:** Use of VLANs to segment traffic for PCs, servers, and printers.

## Addressing Solutions

- **Microenterprise A:** Network 192.168.1.0/24
- **Microenterprise B:** Network 192.168.2.0/24
- **WAN Network:** 10.0.0.0/30 for the point-to-point connection between the routers.

## Physical and Logical Design

- **Physical Design:** Location of network equipment in each microenterprise and cabling diagram.
- **Logical Design:** Network segmentation into VLANs and VLAN configuration on the switches.

## Economic Proposal

- **Equipment Costs:** Detailed costs of routers, switches, cables, and other necessary equipment.
- **Implementation Costs:** Labor for installation and configuration, and training for personnel.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Technical support and software updates.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive solution for the merger of two microenterprises, improving network connectivity, security, and efficiency. The implementation of this infrastructure will enable smooth integration and optimal network performance.
